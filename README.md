### Hi, I'm David Harting ðŸ‘‹

I am an experienced web developer working on tools for analytics engineers.
I work remotely from Indiana as an engineering manager at [dbt Labs](https://www.getdbt.com).

I believe in working hard and living slow. I share life with my wife and my dog. I am fortunate enough to enjoy leisure time, which is filled with walks, wine, books, and games (I am very much into Picross right now).

At work, I am happiest working closely with product and design to navigate tradeoffs and to ship quickly. I am passionate about code review and testing.
